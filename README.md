# CAR SALES SHOWROOM:
Car sales showroom is designed for two different types of users. Client user who wants to buy a car and an admin user who is dealing with client’s requests. User interface for both users is different from each other. Client user can be any number of users who are visiting car sales showroom website. They are allowed to view website, cars and book a test drive for any available car. Admin user is required ID and password to access the application. 
Admin side of car sales showroom is designed to work like a web software. Admin is required to learn it in order to use it. Learning it is simple and easy, user interface for admin is self-explanatory simple to understand and follow along. It keeps you on the track and provides all useful information that you need on the same page where you are a performing task.
At the moment I have left Admin login button present on client site just for evaluation purposes in actual requirement client user is not intended to see admin login button.
